On the backend, I integrated Firebase Realtime Database to ensure real-time data storage and retrieval, and Firebase Authentication to facilitate secure user login. To manage project tasks and maintain sprint tracking, I used GitHub with Kanban boards. The Agile approach was reinforced by the use of HEART metrics to measure success and Crazy 8 brainstorming for innovative problem-solving. The app also utilized web APIs and cloud functions for server-side logic, data processing, and seamless integration of external services. Battleship \u2013 Javascript, Python Spring 2022 Developed a Battleship game in Javascript on Khan Academy. The game consists of a start screen, end screen, attempt counter, and hit counter as a user attempts to find battleships on a 10 by 10 game board before the maximum number of tries is reached. Also reimplemented in Python with text-based output. Snake \u2013 Python Summer 2021 Developed a Snake game in Python using PyGame and Random libraries.
