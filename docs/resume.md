## Project Experience
### TasteBuds Recipe App – Thunkable, Firebase, GitHub	     				         	         
*Spring 2024*

As part of a 5-person team, I developed a full-stack recipe-sharing app, leveraging Agile methodologies to guide the development process. The front-end was built using Thunkable, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface. On the backend, I integrated Firebase Realtime Database to ensure real-time data storage and retrieval, and Firebase Authentication to facilitate secure user login. To manage project tasks and maintain sprint tracking, I used GitHub with Kanban boards. The Agile approach was reinforced by the use of HEART metrics to measure success and Crazy 8 brainstorming for innovative problem-solving. The app also utilized web APIs and cloud functions for server-side logic, data processing, and seamless integration of external services.

### Battleship – Javascript, Python
*Spring 2022*

Also reimplemented in Python with text-based output.
